To craft a block of rails in Minecraft, you'll need six iron ingots and one stick. First, gather the required materials. To obtain iron ingots, you'll need to mine iron ore, which is found in caves or underground. Once you have the iron ore, smelt it in a furnace using fuel like coal or wood to create iron ingots. To get a stick, craft two wooden planks by placing logs in the crafting grid and then turn them into planks. Afterward, place two wooden planks vertically in the crafting grid to make sticks.
Next, open your crafting table, which provides a 3x3 crafting grid. In this grid, place the six iron ingots in the first two rowsâ€”three iron ingots in each row. Then, place the stick in the center of the grid. Once the materials are arranged correctly, you will see the block of rails appear as the resulting item. Simply drag the block of rails into your inventory, and you can now use it to create minecart tracks for transportation.
